  Notes:
  - Can add as many fields as necessary, however this will not be a pretty solution 
  - My goal is to have a JS list like this - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_lists.asp where 
    a user could search through ingredients that we have in our DB and select which ones they want to add
